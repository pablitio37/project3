# INSTALL EXPRESSJS
Install ExpressJS
Remember that Express is a framework for Node.js, therefore a lot of things developers would have programmed is already taken care of out of the box. Therefore it simplifies development, and abstracts a lot of low level details. For example, Express helps to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

# MONGODB DATABASE
MongoDB Database
We need a database where we will store our data. For this we will make use of mLab. mLab provides MongoDB database as a service solution (DBaaS), so to make life easy, you will need to sign up for a shared clusters free account, which is ideal for our use case. Sign up here. Follow the sign up process, select AWS as the cloud provider, and choose a region near you.

I encountered a blockage here, and it has to do with the connection string to access the database. i patiently edit my password, username, network access and database name. eventualy, i have this result.
